"$pkgname - set background image for the root window"
""
"hsetroot is a tool which allows you to set wallpapers ("root pixmaps")"
"for X. It has a lot of options like rendering gradients, solids, images"
"but it also allows you to perform manipulations on those things, or "
"chain them together.  You could use one standard background image for "
"instance, and using tint to make it fit your current theme. And yes, "
"of course it is compatible with semi-translucent applications like "
"aterm and xchat :)"
